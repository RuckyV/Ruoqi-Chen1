			<b>attribution, BY:</b> The licensee must make his name known to the owner of the work in the proper way. As of version 2.0, all CC licenses require attribution.

            <h2>Web Performance & Maintenance</h2>
            <p><b>Here are five ways to reduce page load time:</b><br>
                1. Compress resources<br>
            Compress js,css and image files<br>

                2. Reduce the number of http requests<br>
            Merge js,css requests, using Sprite diagrams<br>
            

                3. Style first, logic second<br>
            The js file is placed at the end of the body tag (Yahoo Optimization guide)<br>
            

                4. Optimize the request speed<br>
            Resource requests are retrieved nearby using CDN links, or the server caches the resource<br>
            

                5. Reduce DOM operations<br>
            Too much DOM manipulation can cause rearrangements and stress the rendering process<br>

            <h2>Web security</h2>
            <p>
                1. Port penetration<br>
            Block unnecessary ports so that when they are closed or changed, unfriendly visitors are like chickens with their heads cut off.<br>
            <br>
                2. Password attacks<br>
            It is recommended that the password contain at least 10 characters and contain a combination of digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, and punctuation marks. The maximum validity period of the password should not exceed 30 days. The account lockout period and the account lockout threshold should be set.<br>
            <br>
                3. Network monitoring<br>
            To prevent such snooping, we divide the network into vlans and isolate important computers. Then all the important data in the network will be encrypted transmission, and then the use of "honey pot" technology to create a false terminal full of loopholes, seduce the listener lost direction, finally, we also need to use antisniffer tools to regularly implement anti-monitoring network, sniffing the abnormal data in the network.<br>
            <br>
                4.DDoS<br>
            You have to do the first level of identity testing; Second, we need to hide critical services behind a separate firewall; Close unnecessary ports and services again. Finally, we need to periodically scan the network master node.<br>
            <br>
                5. System vulnerability<br>
            Pay attention to antivirus software and hardware firewall, but also regular, periodic repair software, system, hardware, firewall and other security system patches, in order to prevent a small vulnerability caused irreparable losses.<br>
